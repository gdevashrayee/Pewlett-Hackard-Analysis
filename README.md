# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct analysis for Pewlett Hackard including information about the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company in order to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and to prepare a mentorship initiative.
